# Assignment 03 – Linear Regression

## Dataset
- Dataset: Medical Insurance Dataset (Kaggle)
- Number of records: 1300+
- Target Variable: charges 

## Data Cleaning
- Checked missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used correlation heatmap to detect multicollinearity
- Visualized relationship between features and target variable

## Data Split
- Training set: 80%
- Testing set: 20%

## Model Building
- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Library: Scikit-learn

## Model Evaluation
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): XXXX
- R² Score: XXXX

## Interpretation
- Age and BMI have positive impact on insurance charges
- Smoking status significantly increases charges

## Conclusion
- Linear Regression performed reasonably well
- R² score indicates good model fit
- Model can be improved using feature selection or regularization
